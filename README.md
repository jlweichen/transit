## Transit:  A Data Analysis Project Using R to Analyze the Chicago 'L'


This project is to use open data and the Twitter API to look at activity around the Chicago area, especially along the Blue Line of the 'L'.

### Inspiration

I visited Chicago in the summer of 2017 for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The 'L' is known to railfans around the world as one of the most extensive elevated rapid transit lines in the United States. As someone interested in statistics and public transportation, I sought to use my skills to explore the data about the line.

### Imaging

I am using the ggplot2 library to make graphs using the data showing the most popular stops.
